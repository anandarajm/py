Notes:

In print statement, after the text string you need to add a comma and then any variable substitution

but when printing a variable embedded within the text string no comma is needed and a % symbol before the variable substituion 

To print multiple variables in a single print statement, add the variables within () in the end

%r prints any data type variable for substitution (raw data variable) 

round() helps you convert floating point number to integer

When we import a python script to another script, functions imported could be referenced as
import_script.function_name(argumnets)
